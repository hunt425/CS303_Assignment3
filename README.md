#For this program there are 3 main structes and techniques used: Queues, Recursion, and Maps
#For the use of queue, the program collects numbers from the user and moves the front number to the back. There were 2 functions used for this part: one to display the queue to the user, and another that moves the first value to the back by saving the first digit, popping the digit, and then adding it to the end of the queue.
#For the recursion, the user types a string and the program states whether or not it is a palindrome. This program only had one function which compared the letters going from left to right and right to left, and if they were all the same it is considered a palindrome
#For the map I had to create the map with default states and capitals, show the map, change the capital of California from Sacremento to Los Angeles, and then display the capital city of a state entered by the user. For this part there were 3 functions: one to display the map, one to change California's capital, and the other to show the value of a select key
